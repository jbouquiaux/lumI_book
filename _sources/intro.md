# Introduction

Welcome the Lumibook! 
This book contains notebook-based documentation, tutorials, and examples for the computation of the luminescence lineshape of point defects with [abinit](https://www.abinit.org/) and [abipy](https://github.com/abinit/abipy). It is greatly inspired by the [abipy_book](https://abinit.github.io/abipy_book/intro.html). 

Examples of use of abipy are available on the:

* [AbiPy plot gallery](http://abinit.github.io/abipy/gallery/index.html)
* [AbiPy flow gallery](http://abinit.github.io/abipy/flow_gallery/index.html)
* [Matgenb website](https://matgenb.materialsvirtuallab.org)


## IFCs embedding 

This chapter discusses how to obtain phonon modes in extended point defect system with abinit and abipy. After an intial [theory section](), the abinit first-principle computations (launched with abipy workflow) needed are explained and detailed in [...](). Then, the implementation of the embedding procedure per see is presented in section [...](). Finally, a series of example are shown, covering different point defect types (vacancy, substitution, interstitial, or combination). 

## Luminescence lineshape 

This chapter discusses how to compute the (phonon-resolved) luminescence lineshape of point defect. After an intial [theory section](), the abinit first-principle computations (launched with the LumiWork abipy workflow) needed are explained and detailed in [...](). Then, it is shown how to get a first quick post-processing and an approximation of the luminescence lineshape following a 1D model. Finally, the computation of phonon-resolved luminescence lineshape is explained in [...]().
